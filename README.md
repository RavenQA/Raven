# Raven

Raven is the AI-enabled multitool for QA. It's a native desktop app that interfaces directly with any web browser and provides powerful tools and workflows to supercharge your QA team. Developers use IDEs to build; QAs use Raven to test.

- Guide your exploratory test sessions with AI-powered test prompts based on what's on the screen, session history and app source code.

- Share session snapshot links with devs to reproduce bugs with zero effort.
- Seamless integration with Jira, GitHub Issues or wherever you track your defects.
- Create, test and debug Puppeteer scripts with a live REPL.
